Hello! My name is Hanna Johnson and this is my submission for the FBLA Website Coding and Programming event for 2024. 
The fictional business is a clinic named "Great Peninsula Clinic", a reference to the clinic my mother used to work in.
This website features the following: 
A page that lists reasons why a potential employee should apply to work 
A page that lists 3 job opportunities at the clinic
A submission form to apply for the jobs
