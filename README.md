Hello! I'm Hanna Johnson, and this is my submission for the FBLA Website Coding & Development competition. The business that the website is for is a fictional business called "Great Peninsula Clinic". 

This website contains the following: 
- A page listing job openings
- A page listing why someone should apply to work at the business
- An form through which an applicant may submit an application.
